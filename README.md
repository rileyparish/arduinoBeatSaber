# arduinoBeatSaber
This repository is an attempt to use Arduino to play Beat Saber with real lasers (in conjunction with various other physical and software components).

If you want to build something like this yourself, keep in mind that the specific photoresistor thresholds and mouse movement values are dependent upon your physical hardware and screen size (respectively).
You should be able to adjust these values to suit your needs and the core logic should still hold.
